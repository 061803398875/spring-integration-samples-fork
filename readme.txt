					$$$			Welcome to Spring Integration Samples			$$$
					===============================================================
					
To simplify your experience, Spring Integration Samples were split in 4 distinct categories.  
Inside of each category you'll find 'readme.txt' which will contain a more detailed description 
of that category specifics. Each sample also comes with its own 'readme.txt' file explaining details.

Below is a short description of each category.

BASIC
   	This is a good place to get started. The samples here are technically motivated and demonstrate the bare 
   	minimum with regard to configuration and code to help you to get introduced to the basic concepts, API and 
   	configuration of Spring Integration. For example if your are looking for an answer on how to wire service-activator 
   	to a channel or how to apply Gateway to your message exchange or how to get started with using MAIL or XML module etc., 
   	this would be the right place to find a good sample. The bottom line is this is a good place to get started.

INTERMEDIATE
	This category targets developers who are already familiar with Spring Integration framework (past getting started), 
	but need some more guidance while resolving  more advanced technical problems that you have to deal with 
	once switch to a Messaging architecture. 
	For example; If you are looking for an answer on how to handle errors in various 
	scenarios or how to properly configure Aggregator for the situations where some messages might not ever arrive 
	for aggregation etc,. and any other issue that goes beyond a basic understanding and configuration of a 
	particular component and addresses "what else you can do with it" type of problem this would be the right place 
	to find these type of samples.

ADVANCED
	This category targets advanced develoopers who are well familiar with Spring Integration framework but looking to 
	extend it to address a specific custom need by extending from Spring Integration public API. 
	For example; if you are looking for samples showing you how to implement a custom Channel or 
	Consumer (event-based or polling-based), or you trying to figure out what is the most appropriate way to implement 
	custom BeanParser on top of Spring Integration BeanParser hierarchy when implementing custom name space, 
	this would be the right place to look.
	Here you can also find samples that will help you with adapter development. Spring Integration comes with an extensive 
	library of adapters that allow you to connect remote systems with Spring Integration messaging framework. 
	However you might have a need to integrate with system for which the core framework does not provide an adapter. 
	So you have to implement your own. This category would include samples showing you how to implement various adapters.

APPLICATIONS
	This category targets developers and architects who have a good understanding of the Messaging architecture, 
	EIP and above average understanding of Spring and Spring integration and are looking for samples that 
	address a particular business problem. In other word the emphasis of samples in this category is 'business use cases' 
	and how it could be solved via Messaging architecture and Spring Integration in particular. 
	For example; If you are interested to see how a Loan Broker process or Travel Agent process could be implemented and 
	automated via Spring Integration this would be the right place to find these types of samples.
